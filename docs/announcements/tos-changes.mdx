We're announcing an update to the AHQ Store **Terms of Service (TOS)**, effective today, **July 12, 2025**.

Our goal with these changes is to enhance clarity, improve user understanding, and ensure a more secure and trustworthy environment for everyone using AHQ Store. We've made the following key updates:

## Enhanced Clarity and Usage Guidelines

We've refined the language throughout the TOS to make it even easier to understand. The **Usage Guidelines** section now provides clearer expectations for how you can interact with our software, ensuring a fair and respectful experience for the entire community.

## Stronger Contribution Policies

We've added a crucial clarification to the **Contributions** section. While we greatly appreciate community contributions, we now explicitly state that including **malware or any malicious code** in your submissions will result in the immediate blocking of your developer account. This measure is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of AHQ Store.

## Streamlined Updates

To ensure our TOS remains current and relevant, we've clarified our policy on updates. Changes will continue to be posted on our **Discord Servers**, and your continued use of AHQ Store will signify your acceptance of the updated terms.

We encourage you to review the full, updated [**Terms of Service**](/tos) to familiarize yourself with these changes. Your continued use of AHQ Store means you agree to these revised terms.

Thank you for being a part of the AHQ Store community!
