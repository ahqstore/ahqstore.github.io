# Introduction

Welcome to the AHQ Store Guide! This guide enables you to
prepare your application for the platform and to learn about
how to whole system functions without any server.

## A Few Things to know about

Since this is the introduction of the guide to the project that
took **years** to be developed for **three** different platforms,
**Windows, Linux and Android**

We'll address a few common pitfalls about the project:

- This project is fully open Sourced
- We collect no data whatsoever
- All the code used by this project is available in our [GitHub](https://github.com/ahqstore)
- Out current focus is on **Windows and Android** at the moment. Linux users don't be sad guys ðŸ˜‚
- We use a no server architecture
- Our data is **systematically stored** in our data repositories. This also means that all the history of the data is available to all!

## Organization of this Guide

For convenience, we've split the guide into 3 **main** sections:

1. Framework Integration
2. Using the CLI
3. AHQ Store Architecture

## Tone of this guide

This whole guide will not be too formal or too casual. Do look out for a few puns here and there, often with visual illustrations
or maybe an emoji or two? Seems great, right?

## ðŸ¤” How to effectively traverse the huge pages?

The pages might look overwhelmingly large, so before making a PR to shorten the pages, let us tell you about a hack.
Did you notice something on the right side of this page? Something written as **ON THIS PAGE**

Let us attach two screenshots, one from pc and one from mobile.

<div className="tw-flex tw-flex-col md:tw-flex-row tw-gap-2">
  <img src="/img/pc.png" width={300} />
  <img src="/img/mobile.png" width={300} />
</div>

These will help you to directly get into the topic you'd like to view.
