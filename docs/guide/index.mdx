# Introduction

Welcome to the AHQ Store Guide! This guide enables you to
prepare your application for the platform and to learn about
how to whole system functions without any server.

## A Few Things to know about

Since this is the introduction of the guide to the project that
took **years** to be developed for **three** different platforms,
**Windows, Linux and Android**

We'll address a few common pitfalls about the project:

- This project is fully open Sourced
- We collect no data whatsoever
- All the code used by this project is available in our [GitHub](https://github.com/ahqstore)
- Out current focus is on **Windows and Android** at the moment. Linux users don't be sad guys ðŸ˜‚
- We use a no server architecture
- Our data is **systematically stored** in our data repositories. This also means that all the history of the data is available to all!

## Organization of this Guide

For convenience, we've split the guide into 3 **main** sections:

1. Framework Integration
2. Using the CLI
3. AHQ Store Architecture

## Tone of this guide

This whole guide will not be too formal or too casual. Do look out for a few puns here and there, often with visual illustrations
or maybe an emoji or two? Seems great, right?

## Quick Trivia Fact

> This version of AHQ Store is the rewritten version of AHQ Store to integrate best practices
> and a much modern User Interface & User Experience.

> As of 07-Sep-2025, this project is almost 3 years old!
