## Gathering Developer Information

To integrate ahq store into your project. We will need

<code className="tw-border tw-border-dashed tw-p-2">
  <span className="tw-text-xl">AHQ Store Author ID</span>
</code>

To gather this, launch the **AHQ Store** application.

On the sidebar, you'll see a page **Developer**, click that and you'll find
a field named **Developer ID** in the **Profile Detailes** collapsible.

<img src="/img/cli/dev.png" alt="Page showing Developer page" />

and that's it, copy that long id for the next step.

:::info{title="That is 'Developer ID' and not 'AHQ Store Author ID'"}
Don't worry, both of them refer to the same thing. It is a unique id that
identifies an AHQ Store Author. This is not a **secret property** and should
be **public** since it has no implication whatsoever. You still need to send
the **application addition request** from your **GitHub account**. Anyone else
cannot impersonate you.

I think that explains what this information is. Don't worry, its just a
public key. Your GitHub account acts as the private key.
