## Installing the CLI

### Cargo

We have to install the AHQ Store CLI using cargo and cargo binstall.
This means that you need to have **RustLang** installed or you should
look into [prebuilt binaries](#prebuilt-binaries)

There are two ways:

- **cargo binstall** (preferred way)
- **cargo install** (official way)

#### cargo binstall

Its a simple command, you need to have **cargo-binstall** installed. To
install using this. Run

```sh
cargo binstall ahqstore_cli_rs
```

Output (with guide)

```js
INFO resolve: Resolving package: 'ahqstore_cli_rs'
INFO This will install the following binaries:
INFO   - ahqstore.exe => C:\Users\Windows\.cargo\bin\ahqstore.exe

# write yes and then press enter
Do you wish to continue? [yes]/no
 ? yes

INFO Installing binaries...
INFO Done in 8.0826489s
```

#### cargo install

Its a simple command, you need to have **cargo and rust language** installed. To
install using this. Run

```sh
cargo install ahqstore_cli_rs
```

Output (with guide)

```js
Updating crates.io index

Downloaded 1 crate (82.6KiB) in 0.71s

# many lines showing compilation of code....

Installed package `ahqstore_cli_rs v0.9.1`
```

### Package Managers

Other than cargo, we have the **CLI** prepackaged and ready to use for several package managers. If you use any of them, head over to https://github.com/ahqstore/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#readme to find detailed installation instructions

- npm
- yarn
- pnpm
- deno
- bun
- go install
- dotnet
- dart pub
- pip
- flutter pub

For example, if you use npm, you can run :-

```pwsh
npm i -g @ahqstore/cli
```

### Prebuilt Binaries

We have prebuilt binaries at
