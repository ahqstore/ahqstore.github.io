## Beginning the guide

This guide explores how developers can integrate their application with AHQ Store
application system pipeline. It is a friendly but informative and detailed article.

Let us start with OS coverage.

## OS Coverage

AHQ Store covers the following OSes:

### 1. Windows

Windows is an operating system made by Microsoft. The screenshots that you've been till now
are all captured from this operating system. Specifically **Windows 11 24H2 26120.5790**

AHQ Store supports the following file formats:

- .exe: A standard installer option. **AHQ Store does not manage updates for this platform due to it not having a stable API / CLI interface**
- .msi: A standard installer option that is still widely used today
- .zip: Custom zip with a main .exe file that will be linked to the start menu. These are generally portable binaries
- .msix: This is the next generation of installer bundles made by Microsoft.
- .ahqdb: Our custom bundle so that every app can be created into an ahq store application.

### 2. Android

Android is a mobile operating system maintained by Google. AHQ Store supports **apk**, the universal
installer format used by this operating system. We've full support for Updates, Installation, Uninstallation
for this file format.

### 3. Linux

:::info TL;DR
Sorry linux guys, we're quite limited at the moment. Not all linux apps can work with AHQ Store for now.
:::

AHQ Store has limited support for Linux for now. We fully support the **AppImage** file format for application Installation and updates.

We've been thinking of supporting .deb, .rpm but its very tedious and time consuming. So, in future, we're planning to introduce our own
installation format: `.ahqdb` for Linux.

Sadly, this will result in this:

## This Guide

We'll explore AHQ Store Integration by creating a cross platform
**ElectronJS** application with electron-vite and pnpm.
The procedure from **Setting up CLI** is the same for any type of AHQ Store Project.

## 🚀 Let's start

### Scaffolding the electron application

This is how to create an electron vite application

```sh
pnpm create vite
```

This is the output (normalized for clarity)

```js
│
◇  Project name:
│  myapp
│
◇  Select a framework:
│  Others
│
◇  Select a variant:
│  Electron ↗
√ Project template: » React

Scaffolding project in E:\GitHub\myapp...

Done. Now run:

  cd myapp
  pnpm install
  pnpm run dev
```

### Installing Dependencies

Now to install the nodejs dependencies. Run these. Replace `myapp` with the name the command output gave you.

```sh
cd myapp
pnpm install
```

It will download the NodeJS depedencies for the **electron** package and will also setup **react** for the frontend ui.

Discussing how electronjs and react works is outside the scope of this guide. We assume that you know them. If not, we're leaving out a few links to them:-

- ElectronJS: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/
- React: https://react.dev/learn

Back to main topic, after installation `pnpm` users need to approve builds for packages.

### Approving Builds (pnpm only)

Just run this

```sh
pnpm approve-builds
```

As customary, this is the output (with a guide of what to input in the TUI)
The output might vary a but on your pnpm version, but we've annotated it with accuracy

```js
√ Choose which packages to build (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection) · electron, esbuild
# press `a` then press Enter key

√ The next packages will now be built: electron, esbuild.
Do you approve? (Y/N) · Yes

esbuild: Running postinstall script, done in 1.6s
electron: Running postinstall script, done in 45.7s
```

### Reaping the fruit (optional)

To look at the outcome of all this hard work you can run

```sh
pnpm dev
```

and you'll see the electronjs app that you built!
