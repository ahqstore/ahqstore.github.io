title: Quick Notes

I know you still have many doubts left. Lemme tell you a few things

- "Aight, but what about linux, android. How will it work?"
- "Well, well, well. What if I am not using WindowsZip"

Here are a quick notes that you should know.

## Android

This is also quite identical as well.

For android, you have to set three things :-

### `androidUniversal`: "AndroidApkZip"

`"AndroidApkZip"` is the only allowed value and is the only format AHQ Store on Android supports.

This is the standard `.apk` file on android.

### `androidOptions`

`"minSdk"` means the minimum android version that your app runs on. This is used by AHQ Store
to verify if your app can be installed on a certain android device.

You can find abi levels here: https://apilevels.com/

We generally recommend at least **Android 10** i.e. minSdk = 29

```json title="config.json"
"androidOptions": {
  "minSdk": 29, // This specifies the minimum sdk of your android application
  "abi": ["Aarch64", "Armv7", "X86", "X64"] // Generally to be kept as is. This means that it can run on both x86 or x86_64 (Desktop chip) android and armv7, aarch64 (mobile chip) android abi
},
```

### finder.`androidUniversalFinder`

This is already self-explanatory since this is exactly the same

These properties are used by the CLI to fetch the asset from GitHub Releases.

```js title="config.json"
"finder": {
  "androidUniversalFinder": {
    "startsWith": "My.Cool.Application",
    "contains": "Android",
    "endsWith": ".apk"
  },
}
```

## Windows (in depth)

## Linux

:::danger ðŸ”¬ Experimental ðŸ”¥ Breaking
You're heading into the experimental and straight up breaking territory. AHQ Store on Linux
is currently loosely designed with many probable changes or maybe even removal of the platform
altogether for some time (not forever, don't worry)

Hence, you're requested to keep up with the updates & the schema changes and regularly update the
**AHQ Store CLI**
:::

:::warning Hello Linux Folks
We're quite sorry but actually `linuxArm32Platform` is an unsupported platform, that's
highly (100%) unlikely to be supported by AHQ Store. It is just there for the record and
might be removed anytime soon!
:::

First of all we're using a variable here `{arch}`

### Values of `{arch}`

This value generally is any three of the following :

- "Amd64"
- "Arm64"
- "Arm32"

For linux, you only have to set two things :-

### `linux{arch}Platform`: "LinuxAppImage"

`"LinuxAppImage"` is the only allowed value and is the only format AHQ Store on Linux supports.

### finder.`linux{arch}Finder`

This is already self-explanatory since this is exactly the same.

These properties are used by the CLI to fetch the asset from GitHub Releases.

```js title="config.json"
"finder": {
  "linux{arch}Finder": {
    "startsWith": "My.Cool.Application",
    "contains": "Linux",
    "endsWith": "-{arch}.AppImage"
  },
}
```
