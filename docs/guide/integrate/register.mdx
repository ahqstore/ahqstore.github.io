# Register as an AHQ Store Developer

We can register as a developer from the AHQ Store Application itself. We
have integrated the login process with GitHub issues system.

Without wasting further lines of text, lets jump straight into it:

## Login with your account

You can login with your account with AHQ Store using GitHub authentication flow.
This allows our client to communicate with our GitHub community repository.

Note that due to the nature of Git itself, data can never be truly erased from the
git history. You can delete data, but it will still be available.

Proceed with this information. We've been fully transparent as usual

### **Login steps:**

- Run **AHQ Store Application**

- Login with your account

- After logging in, click on the highlighted button

## Register as a developer

This is the second part of the process. Thanks to our newest strategy we have been able to
integrate the process in the AHQ Store app instead to sending you to our GitHub repository and
telling you how to encode information in the format that the robots there understands.

This process will create an issue comment using **your github account.** Please be informed that
the access to your GitHub account is stored on your computer. **NO ONE, INCLUDING AHQ STORE STAFF OR ANYTHING OVER THE INTERNET CAN ACCESS THIS TOKEN**

### **Registration Steps:**

- **Read the information shown on your computer carefully, the screenshot may have out of date content**, after that check the boxed and click "Continue"

- Enter the name that **AHQ Store** should show when someone opens your **developer** account
- Click Continue again
- A browser tab with a github issue page will be opened
- Check if there's a new commit by your **GitHub account** there
- After verifying that, open settings page.
- Click the button highlighted

<img src="/img/reg/05.png" width={600} />

- Now, AHQ Store will reload and you will see a new page in the sidebar **Developer**
- This page will contain important information like **Account ID** that will be used later

:::details{title="The Developer page did not show"}

This may relate to two issues :

- Your account did not get registered due to some error
- You just need to wait

Since, AHQ Store operates on a no server architecture. Sometimes if the client points to
the older commit of our data repository. It might not correctly show pages like **Developer**.
Just verify that https://github.com/ahqstore/repo_community/commits/main/ has a commit
by **Your GitHub Account**.

- If its more than **10minutes** and still there is no commit. Just repeat this step.
- If there is a commit, restart your computer and open AHQ Store so that it loads the newest commit.

This is the type of commit we're talking about
