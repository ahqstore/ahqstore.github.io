## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how AHQ Store ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and discloses information about users ("you" or "your") when you upload data to our public GitHub repository or use our store application. By contributing data to our repository, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

While this policy specifically references GDPR in [Your Data Rights](#your-data-rights), our practices are designed to align with the principles of privacy laws around the world, including those in the U.S. and other region.

## Information You Voluntarily Provide

We only collect the information that you voluntarily provide to us. Our application does not send any data to us, and we do not collect any personally identifiable information from your local machine.

When you voluntarily submit data to our GitHub repository, **you are the one making the commitment**.
Our application acts as a tool to help you create and send the data, but the **git commit and data update are created due to interaction from your own GitHub account**.
This means that the information you provide, along with your GitHub username, **becomes a permanent part of the public repository history, directly attributed to you.**

This includes:

- **Submitted Data**: This includes Application Information (like application download URLs) and any User Information (like a profile picture) that you submit to our repository.
- **Public GitHub Profile Information**: When you contribute to our repository, you are providing us with information from your public GitHub profile, such as your username, public email address, and profile picture."

## How We Use the Information You Provide

We use the information you have voluntarily provided to us for the following purposes:

- **To Maintain and Improve the Repository:** We use your contributions to enhance the quality and value of our open-source project.
- **To Communicate with Contributors:** We may use your contact information to communicate with you about your contributions, project updates, and other relevant information.
- **To Display in Our Open-Sourced Store:** We use the information you have provided to display application data and contributor profile data to the users of our application.

## Information Disclosure

All information this is either

- **collected**, or
- **uploaded** to our **GitHub repository**

is **public** and may be **viewed by anyone** at our **GitHub repository** at

- https://github.com/ahqstore/repo_community
- https://github.com/ahqstore/repo_win32
- https://github.com/ahqstore/repo_linux
- https://github.com/ahqstore/repo_android

We **do not sell, process, trade, or otherwise transfer** your personally identifiable information to any outside parties.

## Third-Party Services

Our project utilizes **GitHub** for hosting, collaboration and data storage. By using our repository, or application, you agree to the collection and use of information by GitHub in accordance with their own privacy policy.

## Your Data Rights

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants individuals certain rights regarding their personal data, including the right to erasure ('right to be forgotten'). Due to the unique nature of our project as a public, open-source repository, we must inform you of certain limitations.

Our project's data is hosted on GitHub and is a permanent, public record of contributions. This serves our legitimate interest in providing a transparent and verifiable public archive of our project's development. Due to the immutable nature of the Git version control system (i.e. due to how Git itself works), it's technically impossible to completely delete information once it has been committed to the repository's history.

For this reason, our processing of your data falls under a recognized exception to the right to erasure, specifically for archiving purposes in the public interest. By contributing to our repository, you consent to your data being processed and stored as a permanent part of this public archive.

While we can remove your data from the latest history of our repositories, all previous versions and the full Git history will still retain a permanent copy of your contribution.

You retain the right to rectify or object to the processing of your data. However, as our data processing is based on our **a strong and necessary reason** in maintaining a public and immutable historical record, we are unable to fulfill requests to object that would compromise the integrity of our repository's history.

If you have any concerns, please contact us at the details provided below.

## Children's Privacy

Our project is not intended for use by children under the age of 21. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 21. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete such information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time **with official notice in our Notices section**. We might notify you of any changes by posting an Accouncement on our project website and discord server. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.
